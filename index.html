<p  class="sidebar-about">This site is clone of the C++ Core Guidelines demonstrating the possible use of github pages. The source files from the master branch are not changed (with the exception of 3 lines added at the top). This site shows how stylesheets, a sidebar and syntax highlighting could be added for better readability (button at bottom of sidebar). Prettier fonts can be used (than github default), and the code-blocks have been adapted not to wrap long lines on large screens.
